# Wirless-Communication-Under-Water

* Aim of project is to find optimal parameter settings such as message length, transmission power, modulation power, and baud rate in order to improve performance of wireless communication in underwater environment.
* Used two acoustic modems to send/receive messages under water utilizing various baud rates.
* Developed C program to log critical information of sent/received messages in order to perform data analysis.
* Developed various scripts using command line utilities such as Bash (Unix shell), AWK, and SED in order to process collected data.
