device name
baud rate
destination ID
transmission mode
power level
length of message (text file of sizes)
number of messages
how fast message is transmitted (the amount of time in seconds between messages)
make sure support of #

format of cofig file (each line):
the name of parameters
followed by the colon sign
space (tab) and the value of the parameter


path to the text file of data on the command line




















modify the thread that handles stdin----it does not read from keyboard
it reads a file it encodes in ascii code and create a modem command


processing on data recieved
convert the recieved message from ascii to message
debug mode---whatever you recieve from the modem (before processing), save them into file (logfile)

save from whatever you recieve from the serial port put into a text file in format	date (time to milliseconds) colon then a new line  


the range from space to ~ printable ascii code (displayed on the screen)




the function cfmakeraw at the beginning of the program explanied at http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/termios.h.html
tcgetatrr return 0 if successful and -1 if not
about tcsetatrr: https://support.sas.com/documentation/onlinedoc/sasc/doc/lr2/tsetatr.htm
why do we do the edit of CLOCAL----why disable modem control lines
about signal tests: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27227585/what-is-sigaddset-used-for
SIGINT and SIGTERM cannot occur while code for sigaction is running-----ask about that in the next meeting
how does sigaction work---to provide examples following video on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahRBRGVTi5w
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rggw61JtGz0


sa_handler = pointer to a signal catching function
sa_mask = additional set of signals to be blocked during the excution of signal catching function
sa_flag = special flags to affect behavior of signal
sa_sigaction = pointer to a signal catching function

similar to signal() function, sigaction() function requires handler function

void handler (int signum)
	this is a function where we replace and change the signal
	int signum passed from the sigaction () function will go to this handler

note SIGINT means that control signal is pressed
note SIGTERM mean signal termination

difference between canonical and non canonical can be found at https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Canonical-or-Not.html

from line 250 until line 280 need further explanation---next meeting

SIG_UNBLOCK:
The resulting set shall be the intersection of the current set and the complement of the signal set pointed to by set.

SIG_BLOCK
The resulting set shall be the union of the current set and the signal set pointed to by set.

need more explanation about the above two.
